Toy Blocks","contestId":"1452","problemIndex":"B","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>You are asked to watch your nephew who likes to play with toy blocks in a strange way.</p><p>He has $$$n$$$ boxes and the $$$i$$$-th box has $$$a_i$$$ blocks. His game consists of two steps: </p><ol> <li> he chooses an arbitrary box $$$i$$$; </li><li> he tries to move <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">all</span> blocks from the $$$i$$$-th box to other boxes. </li></ol> If he can make the same number of blocks in each of $$$n - 1$$$ other boxes then he will be happy, otherwise, will be sad. Note that your nephew can only move the blocks from the chosen box to the other boxes; he cannot move blocks from the other boxes.<p>You don&apos;t want to make your nephew sad, so you decided to put several extra blocks into some boxes in such a way that no matter which box $$$i$$$ he chooses he won&apos;t be sad. What is the minimum number of extra blocks you need to put?</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 1000$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of boxes.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of blocks in each box.</p><p>It&apos;s guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over test cases doesn&apos;t exceed $$$10^5$$$.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>For each test case, print a single integer&#xA0;&#x2014; the minimum number of blocks you need to put. It can be proved that the answer always exists, i.&#xA0;e. the number of blocks is finite.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first test case, you can, for example, put one extra block into the first box and make $$$a = [4, 2, 2]$$$. If your nephew chooses the box with $$$4$$$ blocks, then we will move two blocks to the second box and two blocks to the third box. If he chooses the box with $$$2$$$ blocks then he will move these two blocks to the other box with $$$2$$$ blocks.</p><p>In the second test case, you don&apos;t need to put any extra blocks, since no matter which box your nephew chooses, he can always make other boxes equal.</p><p>In the third test case, you should put $$$3$$$ extra blocks. For example, you can put $$$2$$$ blocks in the first box and $$$1$$$ block in the third box. You&apos;ll get array $$$a = [2, 3, 1]$$$.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1632215295839,"input":"3\n3\n3 2 2\n4\n2 2 3 2\n3\n0 3 0\n","output":"1\n0\n3\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1452/submit","language":"c++"}
